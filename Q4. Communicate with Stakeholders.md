# Analysis

Q.4 Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who isnâ€™t familiar with your day to day work. This part of the exercise should show off how you communicate and reason about data with others. Commit your answers to the git repository along with the rest of your exercise.

### 1. What questions do you have about the data?
A:	The different date fields captured in the receipts dataset such as `dateScanned`, `finishDate`, `createDate`,etc. Why do we have different types of dates and how are each of them significant to the business?\
\
2. How can we connect the receipt data with the revenue data?\
How does receipts generate revenue for the company\
\
3. How my analysis (from task2) drive business decisions? Which specific decisions can be driven out of that analysis?

### 2.	How did you discover the data quality issues?
A: 1. During the exploratory data analysis stage I found out that the users data has key value pair of `'_id'` that stores the user id for each user. I found out duplicate dictiories for mulitple `userId` in the user dataset. Duplication of data is clearly observed. Given that any Engineer will use the `userID` as the primary key for the users table, it should be a unique non redundant value and in the users dataset.\
\
2. Querying the brands table I found out that many items in the brands table have null values in the `category` column. Category is a curcial data point that helps us understand the demand, popularity of the products amoung customer in a given market and hence it is extremely imporant to have `category` associated to each item.\
\
3. Digging into the `rewardsReceiptItemList` dictionary in the `receipts` dataset. I found out there were multiple items missing key value pair for `barcode` and `brandCode`. If we are not able to retrieve `brandCode` or `barcode` for items on the list, it doesn't actually show us the whole picture of purhcase history and the customer purchase behavior. So every item on the receipt should have `barcode` or `brandCode` associated to understand purchase trend for different categories and brands.

### 3. What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?
A: 1. Understanding the process of the data collection and the reason behind why we have a lot of missing data points can help us find solution on how to make the process better in order to collect more data points for receipts and brands dataset.\
\
2. Gather a team of engineers to perform QA in a regular cadence of the database schema to make sure we are keeping the data accurate and clean.

### 4. What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
A: Having information about customer's app activity such as the browsing data of the customer in the app, using that we can create customer affinity bubbles and personalize the app based on customer interest. For example, showing offers on products that the customers are interested in or sending emails for he associated products can enhance customer engagement on the platform and lead to more sales of the products i.e. receipts uploads.

### 5. What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
A: 1. If we don't remove duplicates from the users dataset, It might lead us to wrong direction. Removing duplicates increases one more step to achieve data integrity of the database.\
2. Missing data points such as brandcode and brandcode in receiptItemList will give us incomplete analysis on sales of the products. 
\
To solve the above issues we need to work better on the data collection and interpretation of data via OCR.
When you're scaling your database, it is important to not allow for any redundancies. Redundancies occur when there are several entries in database that contains similar information.
